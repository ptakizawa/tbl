		     		<li>You are given a histological slide from a patient who has been diagnosed with an enlarged spleen. Based on the image below which of the following is the most likely cause of the enlarged spleen in the patient?</li>
		     		<ol type="A">
			     		<li>Viral infection</li>
			     		<li>Bacterial infection</li>
			     		<li>Sickle cell disease</li>
			     		<li>Lymphoma</li>
		     		</ol>
		     		<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is C. First identify what is wrong with the spleen in this image. The red pulp has expanded greatly at the expense of the white pulp, suggesting an accumulation of cells and other material in the red pulp. The most likely cause is a build up of red blood cells that have failed to enter the sinusoids. Sickle cell disease is the best response because the red blood cells are less flexible and less likely to pass between the endothelial cells. The other responses would lead to accumulation of white pulp, which is not seen in this image.</div>

		     		<li>You are given a histological sample of the thymus from a patient who is complaining of muscle weakness and who quickly tires after moderate physical activity. Based on the image below which most likely explains the pathology of the patient?</li>
		     		<ol type="A">
			     		<li>Thymus tumor</li>
			     		<li>Autoimmune disease</li>
			     		<li>Viral infection</li>
			     		<li>Premature atrophy of the thymus</li>
		     		</ol>
		     		<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is B. First identify what is abnormal about the thymus. Note the accumulation of secondary lymphoid follicles with germinal centers. This indicates an active immune response taking place in the thymus. This could suggest either autoimmune disease or viral infection, but the symptoms of the patient are more consistent with an autoimmune reaction, in this case, myasthenia gravis.</div>
