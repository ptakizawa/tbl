			  <h2>Instructions</h2>
	         	<p>Work with your team to answer these questions. These questions are open book.</p>
	         	<div class = "tbq-toggle"><h4>Open question one</h4></div>
				<div class = "tbq hidden">
					<h3>Question One</h3>
					<p>Given what you know about wound healing, why is an Achilles tendon rupture particularly problematic?</p>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>There are insufficient numbers of local stem cells to provide a source of fibroblasts</li>
						<li>There is a high likelihood of infection, since injury is on lower leg.</li>
						<li>There is insufficient vascular supply to support repair.</li>
						<li>Individuals with rupture likely have a congenital or nutritional deficiency in collagen cross-linking, thus making repair difficult.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<br />
				
				<div class = "tbq-toggle"><h4>Open question two</h4></div>
				<div class = "tbq hidden">
					<h3>Question Two</h3>
					<p>A 23-year-old woman receiving corticosteroid therapy for an autoimmune disease has an abscess on her upper outer right arm. She undergoes minor surgery to incise and drain the abscess, but the wound heals poorly over the next month. Which of the following aspects of wound healing is most likely to be deficient in this patient?</p>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Collagen deposition</li>
						<li>Elaboration of VEGF</li>
						<li>Neutrophil infiltration</li>
						<li>Serine proteinase production</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<br />
				
				<div class = "tbq-toggle"><h4>Open question three</h4></div>
				<div class = "tbq hidden">
					<h3>Question Three</h3>
					<p>A 40-year-old man underwent laparotomy for a perforated sigmoid colon diverticulum. A wound infection complicated the postoperative course, and surgical wound dehiscence occurred. Primary closure was no longer possible, and the wound “granulated in.” Six weeks later, the wound was markedly smaller. Which of the following processes best accounts for the observed decrease in wound size over the past 6 weeks?</p>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Elaboration of adhesive glycoproteins</li>
						<li>Inhibition of metalloproteinases</li>
						<li>Myofibroblast contraction</li>
						<li>Resolution of subcutaneous edema</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<br />
				
				<div class = "tbq-toggle"><h4>Open question four</h4></div>
				<div class = "tbq hidden">
					<h3>Question Four</h3>
					<p>A 20-year-old woman undergoes cesarean section to deliver a term infant, and the lower abdominal incision is sutured. The sutures are removed 1 week later. Which of the following statements best describes the wound site at the time of suture removal?</p>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Granulation tissue is still present</li>
						<li>No more wound strength will be gained</li>
						<li>Type IV collagen predominates</li>
						<li>Wound strength is 80% of normal tissue</li>
					</ol>

				<div class = "tbq hidden">
					<h3>Question Five</h3>
					<p>In an experiment, glass beads are embolized into the coronary arteries of rats, resulting in myocardial injury. After 7 days, sections of the myocardium are studied using light microscopy. A trichrome stained section of one of these sections is shown in the figure. Which of the following mediators is most likely being highly expressed to produce this appearance?</p>
					<figure>
						<img class="img-responsive" src="tissue_remodeling/images/tbq_1.jpg">
					</figure>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Epidermal growth factor</li>
						<li>Leukotriene B4</li>
						<li>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)</li>
						<li>Vascular endothelial growth factor</li>
					</ol>

				<div class = "tbq-toggle"><h4>Open question six</h4></div>
				<div class = "tbq hidden">
					<h3>Question Six</h3>
					<p>A 54-year-old man undergoes laparoscopic hernia repair. In spite of the small size of the incisions, he has poor wound healing. Further history reveals that his usual diet has poor nutritional value and is deficient in vitamin C. Synthesis of which of the following extracellular matrix components is most affected by this deficiency?</p>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Collagen</li>
						<li>Elastin</li>
						<li>Fibronectin</li>
						<li>Laminin</li>
					</ol>

				<div class = "tbq hidden">
					<h3>Question Seven</h3>
					<p>In an experiment, a group of test animals is infected with viral hepatitis. Two months later, complete recovery of the normal liver architecture is observed microscopically. A second group is infected but is also subject to hepatic ischemia. After the same period of time, fibrous scars are seen microscopically. Which of the following factors best explains the different outcomes for the two test groups?</p>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Extent of damage to the biliary ducts</li>
						<li>Extent of the hepatocyte injury</li>
						<li>Injury to the connective tissue framework</li>
						<li>Nature of the injurious infectious agent</li>
					</ol>

				<div class = "tbq hidden">
					<h3>Question Eight</h3>
					<p>You know that atherosclerosis is defined in part by accumulation of cholesterol crystals in the vascular intima. You hypothesize that the fibrotic component of the atherosclerosis is at least in part due to chronic persistent inflammation in response to this accumulation of these cholesterol crystals. Which of the following support your interpretation?</p>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Lymphoid infiltrate</li>
						<li>M2 macrophage polarization</li>
						<li>M1 macrophage polarization</li>
						<li>Necrosis</li>
					</ol>

				<div class = "tbq hidden">
					<h3>Question Nine</h3>
					<p>Pulmonary fibrosis can result from chronic inflammation, best described in cases in which there is a chronic acquired immune response to inhaled antigen. Other cases are considered idiopathic in that no such antigen (or other obvious etiology) can be identified.  This latter condition, called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is highly lethal:  overall survival is roughly 50% at 2-3 years.  Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had long been treated with immunosuppression on the theory that some patients despite lack of history of any obvious exogenous or autoimmune stimulus might have an occult immune response that was driving the fibrosis. A recent randomized trial (the PANTHER trial) showed that such treatment (consisting of prednisone plus azathioprine) actually reduced life expectancy in these patients.  Which of the following interpretations of this information is most reasonable?</p>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>There is no role for inflammation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and further attempts to investigate this should be discouraged.</li>
						<li>There may be a role for anti-inflammatory treatment but the doses used in this trial were too high and led to toxicity therefore lower does should be used.</li>
						<li>There may be a role for anti-inflammatory treatment but the doses used in this trial were too low and therefore ineffective and therefore higher does should be used.</li>
						<li>The immune response prevents fibrosis and the therapy inhibits this protective effect of the immune system.</li>
