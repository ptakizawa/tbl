				<h2>Instructions</h2>
			  	<p>First answer these questions as individuals and then answer them with your team using the scratch off card to select you answer. These questions are closed book.</p>
	     		<ol>
	     			<li>After a 24-year-old woman undergoes wisdom tooth extraction, one of the sutures breaks on post-op day 1. The surgeon told her that the stitches would take 4-5 days to fall out on their own, and now she is worried about complications.  In the mirror, she sees that the extraction site is slightly swollen but not red or bleeding, and the wound does not appear to be gaping. She is still on liquid / pureed food diet and is feeling otherwise ok.  She does not smoke or have diabetes. Histology of the extraction site at the time that the suture fell out would most likely show which of the following features?</li>
	     			<ol type="A">
	     				<li>necrosis with many macrophages and neutrophils</li>
	     				<li>numerous capillaries and hyaluronic acid in the extracellular matrix</li>
	     				<li>abundant fibrin and many neutrophils</li>
	     				<li>extensive deposition of mature collagen</li>
	     			</ol>
	     			<hr>
					<br />
					
					<li>A 49-year-old woman undergoes the same surgery.  She has had type 1 diabetes since age 12.   She develops a post-operative surgical wound infection leading to wound dehiscence (wound falling apart).  At the time of the infection, the surgeon debrides material from the wound and sends it to pathology.  This debrided tissue most likely shows which of the following features?</li>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Necrosis with many macrophages and neutrophils</li>
						<li>Numerous capillaries and hyaluronic acid in the extracellular matrix</li>
						<li>Granulomas and multinucleated giant cells</li>
						<li>Extensive deposition of mature collagen</li>
					</ol>
					<hr>
					<br />
					
					<li>A 58-year-old man had chest pain persisting for 4 hours. A radiographic imaging procedure showed an infarction involving a 4-cm area of the posterior left ventricular free wall. Laboratory findings showed troponin I (a marker of myocardial necrosis) of 3.3. Which of the following pathologic findings would most likely be seen in the left ventricular lesion 1 month later?</li>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Chronic inflammation</li>
						<li>Coagulative necrosis</li>
						<li>Fibrous scar</li>
						<li>Complete resolution with restoration of normal myocardium</li>
					</ol>
					<hr>
					<br />
					
					<li>An 18-year-old man lacerated his left ear and required sutures. The sutures were removed 1 week later. Wound healing continued, but the site became disfigured over the next 2 months by the process shown in the figure (of a surgical resection of the ear). Which of the following terms best describes the process that occurred in this man?</li>
					<figure>
						<img class="img-responsive" src="tissue_remodeling/images/raq_1.jpg">
					</figure>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Secondary union</li>
						<li>Keloid formation</li>
						<li>Resolution</li>
						<li>Organization</li>
					</ol>
					<hr>
					<br />
					
					<li>A 39-year-old man incurs a burn injury to his hands and arms while working on a propane furnace. Over the next 3 weeks, the burned skin heals without the need for skin grafting. Which of the following is the most critical factor in determining whether the skin in the region of the burn will regenerate?</li>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Persistence of skin appendages</li>
						<li>Good tissue perfusion</li>
 						<li>Diminished edema and erythema</li>
						<li>Granulation tissue formation</li>
					</ol>
					<hr>
					<br />

					<li>In an experiment involving observations on wound healing, researchers noted that intracytoplasmic cytoskeletal elements interact with the extracellular matrix to promote cell attachment and migration in wound healing. Which of the following entities is most likely responsible for such interaction between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix?</li>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Fibronectin</li>
						<li>Type IV collagen</li>
						<li>Platelet-derived growth factor</li>
						<li>Integrin</li>
					</ol>
					<hr>
					<br />

					<li>A 24-year-old man with acute appendicitis undergoes surgical removal of the inflamed appendix. The incision site is sutured. A trichrome-stained section representative of the site with blue appearing collagen is shown in the figure. How long after the surgery would this appearance most likely be seen?</li>
					<figure>
						<img class="img-responsive" src="tissue_remodeling/images/raq_2.jpg">
					</figure>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>&lt;1 day</li>
						<li>1 month</li>
						<li>1 week</li>
						<li>2-3 days</li>
					</ol>
