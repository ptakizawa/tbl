					<h3>Clinical Case One</h3>
		     		<p>A 20 year-old homeless man with a history of intravenous drug use by his girlfriend, who is also homeless, to be unconscious. He is transported by ambulance to Yale-New Haven Hospital. On arrival to the emergency department, the man's girlfriend tells the physicians that he has been losing a lot of weight lately and has had a cough for several months. Physical examination reveals prominent lymphadenopathy in his cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal regions, along with a white coating on his tongue and a diffuse rash on his body.</p>
		     		<p>A CBC is done, which shows the following:</p>
		     		<ul>
			 			<li>WBC 				3,400/mcL (normal 4-10,000)</li>
			 			<li>Hemoglobin	11.3 g/dL (normal 13.5-17.5)</li>
			 			<li>Platelets			100,000/mcL (normal 150-350,000)</li>
		     		</ul>
			 		<p>The WBC differential reveals 80% neutrophils, 10% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 3% eosinophils, and 1% basophils.</p>
			 		<p>Which of the following results most likely belongs to him?</p>
