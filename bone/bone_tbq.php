		     		<li>After the annual football game between the first and second year students, one of your classmates complains of pain in her arm. An X-ray reveals a small fracture and a histological sample results in the image below. Which process is occurring in the image?</li>
			 		<ol type="A">
						<li>Endochondrial ossification</li>
						<li>Bone modeling</li>
						<li>Bone remodeling</li>
						<li>Intramembraneous ossification</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is A but a case can be made for answer C. Although intramembraneous and endochondrial ossification are prominent during development, both processes also occur after development to repair fractures. Intramembraneous and endochondrial ossification can be differentiated by the absence or presence of cartilage. The image reveals cartilage in the center. Note the chondrocytes (dark cells within a clear matrix, which is characteristic of chondrocytes). Also, the glassy appearance of the material suggests hyaline cartilage. One could also argue for C. The initial bone that is synthesized to a repair a fracture is woven bone. The woven bone is eventually remodeled into lamellar bone.</div>

		     		<li>Given the histological image below from a patient's bone, which of the following most likely explains the condition of the patient?</li>
		     		<ol type="A">
						<li>Too much mechanical stress on the bone</li>
						<li>Elevated parathyroid hormone</li>
						<li>Elevated serum calcium</li>
						<li>Fracture in the bone</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is B. There are several active osteoclasts on the bone; note the multiple nuclei in the cells. Also, note that divots in the bone where the osteoclasts have digested bone. One does not see active osteoblasts in the image, especially not on the opposite side of the bone from the osteoclasts. This suggests that bone modeling is not happening which eliminates A (recall that mechanical stress can trigger bone modeling). Elevated calcium would be expected to increase bone synthesis and a fracture in bone would show formation of new bone to repair the fracture.</div>
