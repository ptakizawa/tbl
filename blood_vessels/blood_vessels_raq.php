					<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is A (muscular artery). The easiest way to decode this image is to note the internal and external elastic lamina which are the dark wavy lines of elastic fibers near the top and bottom of the image. The two lamina define the edges of the media layer. Note the media lack elastic fibers (little dark staining material) and is very thick. This makes the vessel a muscular artery.</div>

					<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is B (small muscular artery). First, it is important to note that this is an image of a blood vessel in longitudinal section. We can determine this by looking at the shape of the nuclei in the smooth muscle cells that surround the blood vessel. Note the round nuclei which means that the smooth muscle is oriented into and out of the plane of the image. The number of layers of smooth muscle cells suggest this is a small muscular artery. It is too small to be an elastic artery. Although the vessel looks collapsed, suggesting it might be a venule, recall that this is longitudinal section of the vessel and not a cross section, and therefore, the blood vessel is not collapsed. Lastly, the lack of red blood cells may suggest this is a lymphatic vessel. However, the thick layer of smooth muscle cells eliminates this as a lymphatic vessel.</div>

			 		<li>Identify the blood vessel</li>
			 		<ol type="A">
						<li>Fenestrated capillary</li>
						<li>Venule</li>
						<li>Continuous capillary</li>
						<li>Discontinuous capillary</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is C (continuous capillary). Note the capillary lacks fenestrae which eliminates fenestrated and discontinuous. The small size of the vessel (note the red blood cell fills the lumen) and the lack of smooth muscle eliminate the option of it being a venule. Also note that this sample comes from cardiac muscle (sarcomeres and numerous mitochondria) which have continuous capillaries.</div>

			 		<li>Which of the following activities is associated with the indicated blood vessel?</li>
			 		<ol type="A">
						<li>Gas exchange</li>
						<li>Increase vascular resistance</li>
						<li>Distribution of blood</li>
						<li>Emigration of immune cells</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is B (increase vascular resistance). First identify the type of vessel. Note it has a single layer of smooth muscle cells and the lumen is large enough to accommodate several red blood cells. This eliminates it being a capillary and being involved in gas exchange. Note also the vessel has retained its shape eliminating it being a venule and involved in emigration of immune cells. Thus, the vessel is most likely an arteriole. Recall that muscular arteries are the ones that regulate distribution of blood to the different tissues and organs, whereas arterioles primarily control blood flow into capillary beds to protect the capillaries from hydrostatic pressure. The large number of arterioles mean that they are the source of most vascular resistance in the cardiovascular system.</div>
