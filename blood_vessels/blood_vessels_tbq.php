			<h2>Instructions</h2>
	         	<p>Work with your team to answer these questions. These questions are open book.</p>

		     		<li>You are given the image below of a coronary artery from a patient who complained of chest pains and asked to identify to the intimal layer of the image. Which section do you choose?</li>
					<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is B. First identify the other layers of the blood vessels. A is the adventitia, note the sparse number of cells and large amount of connective tissue. C is the media, note that external and internal elastic lamina that defines the borders of the media. Everything between the internal elastic lamina and lumen is the intima. The increased size of the intima is due to the accumulation of lipid (light staining region), immune cells, smooth muscle cells and connective tissue.</div>

		     		<li>You are given the image below of a pulmonary artery and asked to comment on its appearance. Which of the following would you choose to say.</li>
		     		<ol type="A">
						<li>Looks normal to me</li>
						<li>The media shows an over proliferation of smooth muscle cells</li>
						<li>The adventitia is thickened</li>
						<li>The media is thickened due to excess protein</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is D. Note the small size of the lumen relative to the wall of the artery which indicates something is wrong with this blood vessel. The adventitia layer looks normal, but the media layer is clearly a lot thicker than a normal artery. The number of cells in the media does not look to be significantly more than a normal muscular artery, but there is a lot more extracellular material. This indicates an increase in protein in the media. The protein comes from elevated synthesis of matrix proteins by the smooth muscle cells. This image is an example of pulmonary hypertension. The increased pressure damages the artery which responds by making more matrix proteins.</div>
