				        <h3>Case one</h3>
				        <p>The patient, a 74 year old lady, who presented to her Primary Physician for a very gradual onset of shortness of breath and fatigue.</p>
						<p>The patient's daughter who accompanied her to the visit told the Primary Physician that over the past year her mother was eating less, was in general more disinterested in her surroundings and was getting very forgetful.  She had lost about 10 lbs over this period of time.</p> 
						<p>The patient had been getting screening colonoscopies at appropriate intervals since the age of 50. She had never had a colonic polyp detected and her last colonoscopy was only a few months previously.  The preparation of the colon was reported to have been excellent enabling a thorough examination of the colon and once again no lesion was identified.</p>
						<h3>Physical Exam</h3>
						<p>Other than pallor and glossitis (a smooth  furrowed tongue with loss of papillae)  the examination was normal.</p>

							<li>Platelet count:  154 x  109/L (169 - 358)</li>
							<li>Blood Smear:  see next slide</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Blood Smear</h3>

						<br />
						<p>Based on the History, Physical Examination, CBC and the blood smear, the patient's Primary Physician put all the pieces of the puzzle together, and ordered a few other appropriate blood tests.</p>
						<p>Then, because the daughter mentioned that her mother was not eating well, had lost appetite (anorexia) and head lost 10 lbs in weight he sent the patient to a Gastroenterologist for consideration of an Esophago-Gastro-Duodenoscopy (EGD).</p>
						<h3>Questions</h3>
						<p>What was the type of anemia that the patient had?</p>
						<p>What were the other blood tests that the physician ordered</p>
