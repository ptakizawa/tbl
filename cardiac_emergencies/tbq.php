		                    <h3>Case One</h3>
			                <p>You are working in the emergency department when you are asked to evaluate a 57 year-old man with a history of a bicuspid aortic valve and poorly controlled hypertension presenting with acute chest pain.   He appears pale and diaphoretic, with a heart rate of 110 bpm and blood pressure 132/58.  Exam is notable for a II/VI systolic ejection murmur and a diastolic decrescendo murmur best appreciated at the RUSB and LLSB, bibasilar crackles, and elevated jugular venous pressure.  CBC  is notable for WBC 14 and BMP is notable for Cr 1.8 (other labs still pending).  EKG shows sinus tachycardia and 1mm inferior ST depression.  Chest X-ray shows a widened mediastinum and enlarged cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion.</p>			                
			                <h4>Question one</h4>
			                <p>What is the best next diagnostic evaluation to perform?</p>
			                <ol type="A">
			                    <li>Transthoracic echocardiogram</li>
			                    <li>Transesophageal echocardiogram</li>
			                    <li>CT angiography</li>

		                    <h3>Case Two</h3>
			                <p>You are a resident covering the intensive care unit overnight and you are admitting a 66 year-old woman presenting with acute onset dyspnea and hypoxia.  Her vitals include Tmax 101.8, HR 120 bpm, BP 108/64, satting 76% on RA up to 97% on 100% NRB.  Exam is notable for diffuse rales (crackles) throughout both lung fields, II/VI holosystolic murmur at apex, and diminished distal pulses with slightly cool extremities.  EKG shows  sinus tachycardia with diffuse submillimeter ST depression.</p>
			                <h4>Question one</h4>
			                <p>Which of the following most likely describes the patientâ€™s hemodynamics?</p>
			                <ol type="A">
				                <li>low preload, low cardiac output, high afterload</li>

								<li>high preload, low cardiac output, high afterload</li>
								<li>high preload, high cardiac output, low afterload</li>

		                	<h4>Question two</h4>
			                <p>What is the most likely diagnosis??</p>
