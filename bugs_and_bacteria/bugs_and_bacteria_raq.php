			<h2>Instructions</h2>
	         	<p>First answer these questions as individuals and then answer them with your team using the scratch off card to select you answer. These questions are closed book.</p>
	     		<ol>	
 					<li>The tick vector of Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, is</li>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Rhipicephalus</li>
						<li>Dermacentor</li>
						<li>Ixodes</li>
						<li>Ornithodoros</li>
						<li>Pediculus</li>
					</ol>
					<!--Explanation:  C.  Lyme disease, as well as anaplasmosis and babesiosis, is spread by Ixodes ticks in the US northeast and upper Midwest. -->
					<hr>
					<br />
					<li>To transmit Lyme disease, it is generally necessary for the tick to remain attached for 24 hours or longer.  This is because:</li>
		     		<ol type="A">
		     			<li>The spirochete has to migrate to the tick salivary glands.</li>
		     			<li>The tick hypostome doesn't penetrate deeply enough before then</li>
		     			<li>The tick has to secretes proteins which suppress host immunity</li>
		     			<li>The spirochete has to adapt its surface lipoproteins to the mammalian host</li>
		     			<li>The spirochete has to attract the appropriate population of host cells to invade</li>
		     		</ol>
		     		<!--Explanation:  D.  Borrelia burgdorferi has an interesting genome; as an obligate parasite, it lacks an extensive suite of metabolic proteins, but has a large array of surface lipoproteins customized to aid survival in either the invertebrate (tick) host or the mammalian host.  After it senses that the tick host is taking a meal, it begins replacing surface molecules from the invertebrate suite to those adapted to the mammalian host, a process which requires 24h or more before the spirochete is ready to infect a mammalian host. -->
				 	<hr>
					<br />
					<li>The characteristic erythema migrans rash of Lyme disease occurs during which phase of illness?</li>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>The first day after the tick bite</li>
						<li>The first days to weeks of illness</li>
						<li>During the highly-symptomatic neurological stage of illness</li>
						<li>During the asymptomatic period after primary illness</li>
					</ol>
					<!--Explanation:  B.  The EM rash typically appears between 3-30 days after a tick bite (7 days is average, and lasts for a few days or weeks.-->
					<hr>
					<br />
					<li>H4.	Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, and Anaplasma all lack (or have minimal or altered versions of) which common bacterial structure?</li>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Cell wall</li>
						<li>RNA polymerase beta</li>
						<li>Membrane porin channels</li>
						<li>Ribosomal protein S7</li>
						<li>GyrA protein</li>
					</ol>
					<!--Explanation:  A.  All three of these organisms lack (or have only rudimentary versions of) the peptidoglycan  cell wall essential to most bacteria.  One implication of this is that cell-wall active antibiotics, including the penicillins and cephalosporins, are ineffective against there organism.-->
					<hr>
					<br />
					<li>The approach to diagnosis and treatment of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is best described as:</li>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Perform a skin biopsy and confirm disease by PCR testing prior to treatment</li>
						<li>Collect blood cultures, begin empiric treatment</li>
						<li>Treat empirically without laboratory diagnosis</li>
						<li>Perform skin biopsy for reference-lab testing, begin empiric treatment.</li>
						<li>Test for rickettsia by specific PCR on blood prior to treatment.</li>
					</ol>
					<!--Explanation:  C.  Because RMSF may be a rapidly-progressive and lethal disease, and because diagnostic procedures typically involve sending a skin biopsy specimen to a reference laboratory rather than in-house testing, immediate treatment without a definitive diagnosis (while a sample is collected and being processed) is standard of care.-->
					<hr>
					<br />
					<li>Co-infection with which two organisms below is most common?</li>
			 		<ol type="A">
						<li>Borrelia and Anaplasma</li>
						<li>Babesia and Coxiella</li>
						<li>Rickettsia and Elichia</li>
						<li>Borrelia and Ehrlichia</li>
						<li>Babesia and Rickettsia</li>
					</ol>
					<!--Explanation:  A.  Borrelia and Anaplasma are spread by a common vector, the Ixodes tick; co-infection with these organisms, as well as with Babesia, is relatively common.  The other pairs in this question are spread by different vectors, and are rarely found together in the same patient.-->
					<hr>
					<br />
					<li>Epidemic typhus is spread by</li>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Animal tissues, especially placenta</li>
						<li>Dermacentor</li>
						<li>Ixodes</li>
						<li>Sarcoptes</li>
						<li>Pediculus</li>
					</ol>
					<!--Explanation:  The human body louse, Pediculus humanus humanus, is the primary vector of epidemic typhus.-->
					<hr>
					<br />
					<li>Which cell type does Babesia predominantly infect?</li>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Neutrophils</li>
						<li>Monocytes</li>
						<li>Red blood cells</li>
						<li>Lymphocytes</li>
						<li>Vascular epithelial cells</li>
					</ol>
					<!--Explanation:  Babesia is a parasite related to malaria, and infects human red blood cells.-->
					<hr>
					<br />
					<li>Which cell type do Rickettsia predominantly infect?</li>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Neutrophils</li>
						<li>Monocytes</li>
						<li>Red blood cells</li>
						<li>Lymphocytes</li>
						<li>Vascular epithelial cells</li>
					</ol>
					<!--Explanation:  Rickettsia predominantly infect vascular epithelia cells, and recruit actin and other cytoskeletal proteins to spread directly from cell to cell.-->
					<hr>
					<br />
					<li>The drug of choice for Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, and Anaplasma infections is:</li>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Penicillin G</li>
						<li>Ceftriaxone</li>
						<li>Doxycycline</li>
						<li>Isoniazid</li>
						<li>Streptomycin</li>
					</ol>
					<!--Explanation:  The drug of choice for these cell-wall-deficient intracellular pathogens is doxycycline.  Penicillin G and ceftriaxone are cell-wall active agents without activity against these microbes, streptomycin has poor penetration into human cells.  Isoniazid is an anti-tuberculosis antibiotic which has targets relatively specific to Mycobacterium tuberculosis; it has little activity against other bacteria.-->
