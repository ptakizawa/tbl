			},
			"img": "raq_1.jpg",
			"options": [
				"Lymphocyte",
				"Monocyte",
				"Basophil",
				"Neutrophil"
			],
			"explanation": "Note the cell is much larger than the surrounding erythrocytes and it has an indented nucleus. Both indicate that this cell is a monocyte."
		}
	}, {
		"question": {
			"number": "2",
			"stem": {
				"paragraph_1": "Name a condition in which these cells will be elevated."
			},
			"img": "raq_2.jpg",
			"options": [
				"Bacterial infection",
				"Viral infection",
				"Parasitic infection",
				"Anemia"
			],
			"explanation": "First identify the cell as an eosinophil: bi-lobed nucleus and orange granules. Next, recall that the granules contain major basic protein that kills parasites."
		}
	}, {
		"question": {
			"number": "3",
			"stem": {
				"paragraph_1": "Which of the following components is/are found in the dark, blue granules in the cell in the center of the image?"
			},
			"img": "raq_3.jpg",
			"options": [
				"Histamine",
				"Acid hydrolases",
				"Antibodies",
				"Peroxidase"
			],
			"explanation": "The presence of the large, blue granules indicates this cell is a basophil, which contains histamine and heparin."
		}
	}, {
		"question": {
			"number": "4",
			"stem": {
				"paragraph_1": "Identify the cell with a nucleus."
			},
			"img": "raq_4.jpg",
			"options": [
				"Monocyte",
				"Basophil",
				"Neutrophil",
				"Lymphocyte"
			],
			"explanation": "The round nucleus and lack of dark blue granules eliminate neutrophil and basophil, respectively, as possible answers. The nucleus is not indented and the cell is only slightly larger than a erythrocyte, eliminating monocyte."
		}
	}, {
		"question": {
			"number": "5",
			"stem": {
				"paragraph_1": "Under which condition would you expect to see an increased number of these cells?"
			},
			"img": "raq_5.jpg",
			"options": [
				"Bacterial infection",
				"Viral infection",
				"Parasitic infection",
				"Anemia"
			],
			"explanation": "First identify the cell as a band cell: horseshoe-shaped nucleus and mix of purple and lilac granules. Recall that band cells are precursors to neutrophils and that neutrophils are increased during bacterial infections."
		}
	}, {
		"question": {
			"number": "6",
			"stem": {
				"paragraph_1": "What is the expected MCV for the CBC below?"
			},
			"img": "raq_6.jpg",
			"options": [
				"&lt; 80 fL",
				"80 - 100 fL",
				"&gt; 100 fL"
			],
			"explanation": "The size of the red blood cells is smaller than the size of the lymphocyte nucleus located on the right side of the smear. Given that a normal MCV, which describes red cell size, is 80-100 fL, the MCV of these cells must be less than 80 fL."

			"number": "7",

				"paragraph_1": "What is the expected RDW for the CBC below?"
			},
			"img": "raq_7.jpg",
			"options": [
				"&lt; 15%",
				"&gt; 15%"
			],
			"explanation": "The heterogeneous sizes of the various red blood cells makes for a large size distribution. The RDW is therefore high, greater than 15%"
