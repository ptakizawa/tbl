		     		<li>You are working with a pathologist and are training a new student who has mixed up four electron micrographs of samples from different patients. The pathologist asks you to identify the image which belongs to the patient in the first image below. Which of the four electron micrographs do you show to the pathologists?</li>

		     		<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is D. In the first image, note that the skin is overly stretchy, indicating a defect in the connective tissue that prevents the skin from resisting tension. Collagen is the primary component in skin that resists tension, so next find which of the four images shows a defect in collagen. A and D show collagen fibrils in cross section. Note in A that the fibrils are closely packed and each fibril is round. In D, there is more space between the fibrils and some of the fibrils are misshapen, indicating a structural defect in the collagen. C show elastic fibers; note the amorphous material (elastin) surrounded by fibrillin fibers, and B shows a proteoglcyan.</div>

		     		<li>The same student mixes up images from four different patients. The pathologists asks you for the image from the patient who has arthritis. Which image do you select?</li>
		     		<img class="img-responsive" src="connective_tissue/images/tbq_2.jpg">
		     		<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is D. Because arthritis is a disease of the joints which are composed of mostly hyaline cartilage, we first need to identify which of the images show hyaline cartilage. A is loose connective tissue; note the sparse fibers, scattering of cells and large of proteoglycan (white space). C is brown fat; note the cells have many lipid droplets. B and D are both cartilage; note the chondrocytes (dark cells surrounded by a clear matrix). In the upper right of B, note the perichondrium is intact, whereas in D, there are clefts in the cartilage, indicating damage to the cartilage.</div>
