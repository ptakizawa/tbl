	         	<h2>Venous Thromboembolism</h2>
			 	<p>Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the upper or lower extremities and pulmonary embolism (PE) of the pulmonary arteries, is a major medical problem, responsible for about 100,000 deaths each year in the U.S. VTE often arises in the context of Virchow's triad, defined as the combination of endothelial cell injury, hypercoagulability, and venous stasis.</p>
			 	<p> The mainstay of treatment of acute VTE is anticoagulation. Several different anticoagulants are commonly used, including heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), direct thrombin inhibitors, new oral anticoagulant (NOAC) drugs, and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) such as warfarin. (It should be noted that VKAs cannot be used as the sole anticoagulant upfront due to an initial inhibitory effect on protein C and protein S, which increases the risk of thrombosis with VKAs for the first few days after they are started. As a result, warfarin therapy is usually accomplished with addition of either heparin or low molecular heparin as "bridging" therapy for the first few to several days. Failure to do so may lead to progression of clot burden and tissue ischemia, including necrosis of the skin.)</p>
				<h2>Types of Venous Thromboembolism</h2>
				<p>VTE may be categorized as provoked, unprovoked, or associated with cancer. Provoked VTE is defined as thrombosis occurring as a consequence of a strong provoking factor such as surgery, trauma, or profound immobilization (including plaster cast immobilization). Unprovoked VTE arises in the absence of any provoking factors. Prolonged travel, high-estrogen states (e.g., from oral contraception), obesity, and cigarette smoking are considered minor risk factors for thrombosis; some investigators therefore classify VTE associated with these risk factors as provoked thrombotic events while others classify them as unprovoked or "partially provoked". Cancer-associated VTE means that the thrombosis arises as a result of a malignancy, either a malignancy that has already been diagnosed or one that is undiagnosed. The association between cancer and thrombosis is underscored by the fact that 10% of patients with unprovoked VTE will be diagnosed with cancer a year after their presentation with VTE.</p>

				<h2>Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome</h2>
				<p>Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is an acquired autoimmune, thrombotic condition in which thrombosis occurs in the context of antibodies directed against various cell membrane components. These antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies have a number of important interactions that lead to thrombosis. aPL antibodies interact with endothelial cells via a membrane protein on the endothelial cell surface called beta-2 glycoprotein-1 (B2GPI), inducing the endothelial cells to adopt a procoagulant and proinflammatory physiologic state. The aPL antibodies also increase tissue factor (TF) expression on endothelial cells and monocytes, leading to increased endothelial leukocyte adhesion, cytokine secretion, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis. aPL antibodies bind platelets and potentiate their aggregation, and they block anticoagulant activity in the coagulation cascade via inhibitory molecules such as annexin A5. There is additionally evolving data that complement activation by aPL antibodies is important in the thrombotic and immunologic complications of APS, leading to a proposed "two-hit" model for APS, with the first hit being generation of aPL antibodies, and the second hit being complement activation. These mechanisms are illustrated in the figure below. [Reference: Meroni PL et al, Nat Rev Rheumatol 2011;7:330] </p>

				<h2>Diagnosis of Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome</h2>
				<p>Diagnosis of APS relies on the Sapporo criteria, which require clinical and laboratory criteria. The clinical criteria are vascular thrombosis in the form of VTE or arterial thrombosis (including stroke or heart attack) or pregnancy morbidity, including three or more first trimester miscarriages, one late miscarriage, unexplained fetal loss in the absence of any fetal cytogenetic abnormalities, or preeclampsia. The laboratory criteria require positive testing for any one of the three accepted aPL tests: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, or B2GP1 antibodies. To meet diagnostic criteria for APS, patients must have one clinical criteria and be positive for one laboratory criteria, the latter on two occasions drawn at 12 weeks apart. [Reference: Miyakis S et al, J Thromb Haemost 2006;4:295]</p>
				
				<h3>Primary and Secondary Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome</h3>
				<p>Patients with APS can have either primary or secondary disease. Primary APS arises in the absence of any other known autoimmune disease. Secondary APS arises in the context of another autoimmune disorder, most commonly systemic lupus erythematosus. Affected patients may exhibit livedo reticularis, or a lacy appearance to their extremities due to microvascular occlusion.</p>
				
				<h3>Treatment of Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome</h3>
				<p>The mainstay of treatment of APS is anticoagulation, most commonly with warfarin. In the setting of acute VTE due to APS, as per above warfarin should never be started alone as monotherapy but must always be given in conjunction with bridging therapy either with heparin or low molecular weight heparin. Patients with APS and thrombotic manifestations typically are required to remain on warfarin indefinitely because the risk of recurrent thrombosis when off of anticoagulation is unacceptably high.</p>
				
				<h3>History of Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome</h3>
				<p>The history of APS as a disease entity is very interesting. The origin of aPL testing began in the early 1900s, when Wassermann, Citron, and Neisser developed a test called the Wassermann test as a screening test for syphilis. In this test, heat-treated plasma from donor patients was incubated with liver extract from fetuses that had been afflicted with syphilis; the addition of red blood cells and complement would lead to red cell lysis in donor patients who had been infected with syphilis. Though originally it was surmised that syphilis microorganisms from fetal liver were the trigger for this reaction, subsequent studies demonstrated that the Wassermann reaction could be replicated by a specific component of bovine heart extract, leading to its eventual naming as cardiolipin. </p>
				<h3>Wassermann Test</h3>
				<p>The Wassermann test gained public acceptance early on and became a standard screening test for syphilis in military recruits. However, it was soon noticed that a substantial proportion of patients who tested positive for the Wassermann test did not have syphilis. Such patients were deemed to have a "false positive Wassermann test".</p>
				
				<p>Separate from the Wassermann test, early in the 20th century while characterizing the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), it was noticed that a number of SLE patients had prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT or PTT). This phenomenon was termed "lupus anticoagulant", based on the assumption that such patients would have increased hemorrhagic complications as a result of prolongation of these clotting times. However, it was soon noticed that patients with lupus anticoagulant actually suffered thrombotic complications such as VTE, myocardial infarction, and stroke, more than bleeding complications. Such patients also were recognized to have false positive Wassermann tests, which ultimately led to the identification of antibodies against cardiolipin, a.k.a. anticardiolipin antibodies, as being pathogenic in this disease. It was first thought that anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant bound to cell membrane phospholipids, which led to their naming as aPL and the resulting clinical syndrome of aPL plus thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity as APS. However, later studies elucidated that aPL do not directly bind phospholipids but instead bind to proteins that in turn bind to phospholipids. Other proteins that may be antigenic targets for aPL include B2GP1 (which leads to generation of B2GP1 antibodies), prothrombin (antiprothrombin antibodies), and phosphatidylserine (antiphosphatidylserine antibodies).</p>
				<h3>Mechanisms of Antiphospholipid Antibody Tests</h3>
				<p>An understanding of the mechanics behind aPL testing is critical, both for ruling in or ruling out a potential diagnosis of APS, and for the purposes of cementing one's understanding of coagulation testing in general. Specifics of the aPL testing are as follows:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>PT and PTT: these are standard tests of in vitro coagulation activity that assay formation of fibrin clots in response to an added stimulus. To perform the PT, patient plasma is incubated with TF and phospholipids, and the time it takes for a fibrin clot to form is measured. Because the reaction is dependent on addition of TF, the PT is ultimately a measure of extrinsic coagulation cascade activity. The PTT is similar to the PT except that the reaction is performed without the addition of TF, and with the addition of nonspecific substances such as silica or glass that induce "contact" activation of the coagulation cascade; because of contact activation in the absence of TF, interpretation of the PTT is restricted to intrinsic coagulation cascade activity. 

In many cases of APS, the PTT (and/or sometimes the PT) will be prolonged because of the inhibitory effect of aPL antibodies, which bind to and remove free phospholipids in the PTT reaction. A 1:1 mixing study will not correct due to the presence aPL antibodies.</li>

					<li>Lupus anticoagulant: this is a PTT-based test that contains two parts.
					<ul>
						<li>Dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT): a PTT is performed in which limiting amounts of phospholipids and snake venom are added to the reaction. The snake venom has a strong tendency to form a fibrin clot in the presence of minute amounts of phospholipids. If aPL antibodies are present, they will bind available phospholipids, impairing the ability of snake venom to induce fibrin clot formation, leading to prolongation of the time it takes to form a fibrin clot.</li>
						<li>Phospholipid neutralization test: if the dRVVT shows prolongation of the time it takes to form a fibrin clot, and if that prolongation is due to the presence of aPL antibodies, then addition of large amounts of phospholipids will titrate out the existing aPL antibodies and eventually be able to restore snake venom-induced fibrin clot formation.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<p>Based on the above paradigm, the dRVVT is a screening test for aPL antibodies, while the phospholipid neutralization test is a confirmatory test. Also, with this model in mind, it should be clear why APS is usually associated with a prolongation of the PTT. Because the lupus anticoagulant test is PTT-based, it is important to remember that other things that prolong the PTT can lead to a false positive dRVVT, such as heparin, other anticoagulants, or inhibitors to specific coagulation factors in the intrinsic coagulation cascade.</p>
					<li>Anticardiolipin and B2GP1 antibodies: these tests are actual measurements of antibodies with specificity against cardiolipin or B2GP1. These are reported as antibody titres for each of the major isotypes of IgG, IgM, and IgA. Only high-titre IgG or IgM antibodies are considered positive for APS</li>
				</ol>
				<p>One final comment: remember, the diagnosis of APS requires clinical and laboratory criteria. There are patients have incidental aPL antibodies without any history of thrombosis. It is believed that a subset of those patients may have a higher risk of thrombosis overall, but generally they are not anticoagulated except under extenuating circumstances.</p>
