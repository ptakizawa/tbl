      <p>Team-based learning is a teaching method that uses in-class time to promote higher levels of learning. In contrast to lectures, which focus mainly on delivering content to students, team-based learning uses in-class time for application of knowledge, problem-solving and teamwork. Team-based learning still delivers content, but students learn that content before coming to class, leaving in-class time free for applying what they have learned.</p>
