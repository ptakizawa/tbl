				<h2>Components of a team-based learning session</h2>
				<p>The components of a team-based learning session are divided into those which occur before the in-class session and those that take place during class time. Each of these components is described below. The in-class session is led by a faculty facilitator who moderates discussion and addresses questions from students and teams.</p>
				<hr />
			  	<h3>Component 1: Pre-session Content</h3>
			  	<p>The purpose of this component is for students to learn all of the content and skills which they will need to answer the application questions. The material for this component can be delivered in a variety of formats, including video, readings, website or online slideshow. The type of format used isn’t critical, though students seem to prefer videos. Most important is that the material cover all of the concepts that will prepare the students to tackle the application questions. The material in this component can also include content that is not directly related to the application questions, but is considered important for students to learn.</p>
			  	<h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
			  	<p>Like all instructional sessions, the pre-session materials should have learning objectives that inform students what they should have learned by the end of the pre-session materials.</p>
			  	<hr />
			  	<h3>Component 2: Readiness Assessment</h3>
			  	<p>Readiness assessment comprises two parts: individual readiness assessment and group readiness assessment. Both of these are described below.</p>
			  	<h3>Individual Readiness Assessment</h3>
			  	<p>To assess the extent to which each student has mastered the pre-session material, students take a short quiz that covers the pre-session materials. This quiz is usually given at the start of the in-class session and is then followed by the group readiness assessment quiz. If the in-class time is limited, the students can take the quiz before coming to class, but there are benefits to having the quiz be taken in-class. Students should take the quiz closed-book, relying on what they have retained from the pre-session material to answer the questions. In some settings, the individual quizzes are collected and the scores are recorded. However, at Yale, we treat these quizzes as formative feedback that help students identify the content they haven’t mastered. The next component, the group readiness assessment quiz, will give students an opportunity to learn from their peers.</p>
			  	<p>Multiple-choice questions are often the best format for the readiness assessment quizzes.</p>
			  	<hr />
			  	<h3>Group Readiness Assessment</h3>
			  	<p>The group readiness assessment quiz uses the same questions as the individual readiness assessment quiz, but now, the students work in their teams to answer the questions. The quiz should still be taken closed-book, but the students are free and encouraged to discuss the questions and help the team come to a consensus answer. Teams select their answer on a scratch off card</a>. The card shows four options for each question with a small region for each option that can be removed by scratching with a coin. If the correct answer is selected a star is revealed; an incorrect answer is blank.</p>

			  	<p>After the teams have finished the quiz, the facilitator leads a discussion of the readiness assessment questions to ensure that the students and teams understand content addressed by the question. The discussion should clear up any misconceptions the students have about the content related to the questions and allow students to challenge any of the correct answers to the questions if they think another selection is more appropriate.</p>
			  	<p>There are several benefits of the group readiness assessment quiz. First, students develop communication skills through discussion of the questions with their teammates. The discussion allows students to contribute what they remember from the pre-session material to help their team arrive at the correct answer. Students who recall less from the pre-session material learn from the peers who have a better understanding of the material. Through discussion, all students gain an understanding of the content that will allow them to tackle the application questions.</p>
			  	<p>The discussion will benefit both students who understand the material and students who have less command of the material. During the discussion, students who understand the material will have an opportunity to explain and occasionally teach the material to other students. In addition, the discussion will help students who are less confident with the material to identify misconceptions they have about the material and to ask questions that lead them to a better understanding of the material. Lastly, all students in the team will benefit from hearing different ways fellow students think about and remember the material.</p>
			  	<hr />
			  	<h3>Component 3: Application Questions</h3>
			  	<p>The application questions require students to apply what they learned in the pre-session material to solve a real-world problem. Students will work on and discuss these problems in teams and then come to a consensus answer. These problems should be significantly more challenging than the questions on the readiness assessment quiz, but students should be able to come to a reasonable answer based on their understanding of the pre-session material and discussion with teammates. </p>
			  	<p>Besides being more challenging than the questions on the readiness assessment quiz, the application questions should also present a real-world problem to the teams. The questions should put the students in situations that they might encounter in their future careers (e.g. physician, scientist, etc.). In addition, as in the real world, students should have to come to a final decision when answering the application questions. </p>
			  	<p>The teams show their commitment to an answer by holding up a card that displays their choice. After all teams have committed to an answer, the facilitator leads a discussion of the question and the choices. Teams are given the opportunity to explain their rationale for selecting a particular response and present arguments why their selection is the best choice. The discussion is also a time when the facilitator can clear up any misunderstanding of the material and its applications and/or provide additional examples of how the material can be applied.</p>
