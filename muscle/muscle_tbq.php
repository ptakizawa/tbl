			<h2>Instructions</h2>

		     		<li>You have a patient who has expressed trouble walking. You start to analyze a biopsy from the patient and realize that four slides are unlabeled. Which of the four slides most likely comes from your patient?</li>

		     		<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The best answer is A. Because the patient indicates trouble walking, it indicates a problem in skeletal muscle. First identify the images with skeletal muscle. B is cardiac muscle, striated but central nuclei. C is smooth muscle. A and D are skeletal muscle, large cells with peripheral nuclei. Note all the space between skeletal muscle cells in A compared to D and that the cells in A differ in size. Both indicate that A is pathologic and suggest muscular dystrophy. The different sized cells are due to muscle cells dying and the muscle trying to replace those cells with new muscle cells. The space between the muscle cells is connective tissue that was synthesized to replace the dead skeletal muscle cells.</div>

		     		<li>You are working with a pathologist who studies hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or enlargement of the muscle of the heart. He gives you four slides and images of each slide. Which slide will you select to detect potential hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?</li>
		     		<img class="img-responsive"  src="muscle/images/tbq_2.jpg">
		     		<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The best answer is B. First identify which of the images shows cardiac muscle. C and D are skeletal muscle, large cells with peripheral nuclei. A is smooth muscle, spindle-shaped cells without striations. B is cardiac muscle, striations and central nuclei. C and D are both pathologic. In C some of the cells have white structures in the cytoplasm. These are lysosomes that have accumulated because the cells have lost the ability to digest certain material in the lysosomes. In D, there is an accumulation of cells, note the increased number of nuclei. These are most likely immune cells which suggests infection or an autoimmune reaction.</div>
