			<h2>Instructions</h2>

					<li>Identify the connective tissue layer indicated by the arrow.</li>
					<ol type="A">
					     <li>Epimysium</li>
					     <li>Perimysium</li>
					     <li>Fibrocartilage</li>
					     <li>Endomysium</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is B. Note the arrow points to extracellular matrix that surrounds and separates a group of skeletal muscle cells. That means this is permysium. Endomysium surrounds individual skeletal muscle cells and epimysium surrounds the entire muscle.</div>

					<li>An antibody to which protein will label the structure indicated by the arrow?</li>
					<ol type="A">
					     <li>Myosin</li>
					     <li>Actin</li>
					     <li>Connexin</li>
					     <li>Tropomyosin</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is C. First identify the tissue as cardiac muscle (striated cytoplasm, nuclei in the center of the cells). The dark line is the point of contact between adjacent cardiac muscle cells called intercalated discs. Intercalated discs contain adhesion complexes and gap junctions. Connexins are the protein component of gap junctions.</div>

					<li>In which direction would this tissue contract?</li>
					<ol type="A">
					     <li>Left to right</li>
					     <li>Up and down</li>
					     <li>Into and out of the screen</li>
					     <li>Does not contract</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is C. First identify the tissue as smooth muscle. The cells are too small to be skeletal muscle and are not organized into bundles of cells (fasicles). There are few capillaries within the muscle indicating it is not cardiac muscle. That leaves smooth muscle. You can determine the orientation of the cells based on the shape of the cell and their nuclei. The cells are round and have round nuclei which indicates that they oriented into and out of the screen and that is the direction they would contract.</div>

					<li>Which region becomes shorter during contraction?</li>
					<div class="tbq-toggle"><h5>Show Explanation</h5></div>
					<div class="explanation hidden">The correct answer is A. During contraction the Z-discs are pulled closer together because the myosin filaments in the center of the cell pull on the actin filaments which are attached to the Z-discs. As the Z-discs are pulled closer together, the actin filaments, which are in region A, get pulled over the myosin filaments in region B. Thus, region A shortens during contraction.</div>
