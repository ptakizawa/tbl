				"paragraph_1": "A 30 year-old man develops profound diarrhea after returning back to Connecticut from a summer trip with his family. During his time away, he visited several countries in South America and ate a number of native, uncooked foods. Which of the following blood smears is most likely his?"

				"Panel A",
				"Panel B",
				"Panel C"
			],
			"explanation": "The constellation of diarrhea, recent travel abroad, and consumption of raw foods that could have been contaminated suggests the possibility of a parasitic infection, which would give rise to eosinophilia (Panel A). Panel B shows microangiopathy as would be seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Panel C shows thrombocytosis, which can be primary or reactive."
