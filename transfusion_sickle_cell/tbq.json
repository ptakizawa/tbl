			"paragraph_1": "A 7 year-old female with a history of sickle cell disease (Hgb S/S) is admitted to Yale-New Haven Hospital with fever, total body pain, fatigue, and dark urine. One week earlier she had been hospitalized at a hospital in rural Massachusetts for acute chest syndrome, during which time she underwent placement of a Quinton catheter and an exchange transfusion of 15 units of leukoreduced, Hgb S-negative red blood cells. Her past medical history is otherwise remarkable for having previously received one or two other red cell transfusions as a toddler.",

				"WBC = 7,300/&micro;L",
	     		"Hemoglobin = 4.5 g/dL",
