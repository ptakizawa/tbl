					<h3>Clinical Case One</h3>
		     		<p>A 7 year-old female with a history of sickle cell disease (Hgb S/S) is admitted to Yale-New Haven Hospital with fever, total body pain, fatigue, and dark urine. One week earlier she had been hospitalized at a hospital in rural Massachusetts for acute chest syndrome, during which time she underwent placement of a Quinton catheter and an exchange transfusion of 15 units of leukoreduced, Hgb S-negative red blood cells. Her past medical history is otherwise remarkable for having previously received one or two other red cell transfusions as a toddler.</p>
		     		<p>Upon the current admission, laboratory testing is done that shows the following:</p>
		     		<ul>
			     		<li>WBC			    7,300/&micron;L</li>
			     		<li>Hemoglobin		4.5 g/dL</li>
			     		<li>Hematocrit		  13.5%</li>
			     		<li>Platelets		740,000/&micron;L</li>
		     		</ul>
			     	<p>The reticulocyte count is 0.5%. Total bilirubin is 11 mg/dL; direct bilirubin is 0.2 mg/dL.</p>
			     	<p>A direct Coombs test is performed, which is negative. An antibody screen (i.e., indirect Coombs test) shows reactivity against red cells containing the Kell antigen.</p>
			     	<p>Labs obtained from her earlier hospitalization in Massachusetts show that prior to her red cell exchange transfusion, she had had a negative antibody screen.</p>
			     	<p>What is the most likely explanation for her current anemia?</p>

		     		<ol type="A">
						<li>Aplastic crisis due to parvovirus.</li>
						<li>Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.</li>
						<li>Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction due to transfusion of mismatched red blood cells.</li>
						<li>Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction.</li>
					</ol>
