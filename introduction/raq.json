		"explanation":"The primary function of the thermostat is to regualte the temperature of the coolant. When the engine and coolant is cold, the thermostat closes to recycle the coolant to the engine block, causing it to heat rapidly. When the coolant reaches a minimum temperature, the thermostat open, sending coolant to the radiator where it decreases in temperature."

		"explanation":"The radiator fan blows air through the radiator dissipating the heat from the coolant. When the car is in motion air is forced across the radiator and the fan is not as important. When the car is at idle, the fan is the only source to move air through the radiator."
